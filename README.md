# QArtCode

Arduino code for a [watchface](WatchFaces/QArtCode) for the [SQFMI Watchy](https://watchy.sqfmi.com/), plus Python [server code](Python) which when combined display a different QR code every minute.

Scanning these codes will take you to random objects in the [V&A's collection](https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections). It also tells the time, but very unobtrusively.
